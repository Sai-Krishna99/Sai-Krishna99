## Hi, I’m Sai

ML/AI Engineer focused on building **decision-grade machine learning systems** — forecasting platforms, agentic AI workflows, and LLM-powered decision support that operate reliably under real-world constraints.

### Selected Work

- **[AFDC](https://github.com/ankitlade12/ADFC)** — Adaptive uncertainty calibration for probabilistic forecasting under distribution shift, with emphasis on coverage control and decision-aligned risk management. *(Research, OSS release pending)*

- **[Regime-Aware Forecasting](https://github.com/IndarKarhana/Regime-Aware-Incremental-Time-Series-Forecasting)** — Incremental time series forecasting with regime detection and checkpoint reuse to reduce retraining cost while preserving accuracy. *(Research, OSS release pending)*

- **[Epilog](https://github.com/Sai-Krishna99/Epilog)** — An observability and debugging platform for AI agents, enabling execution tracing, deterministic replay, and human-in-the-loop diagnostics.

- **[TrueLift](https://github.com/Sai-Krishna99/truelift-ai)** — A real-time ML system for promotional cannibalization detection, combining streaming pipelines with ML and LLM-backed adaptive decision support.

### Background & Interests

I work primarily on problems where **uncertainty, system behavior, and decision impact** matter more than isolated model performance.  
My interests include probabilistic forecasting, agent orchestration, ML systems design, and reliability-focused AI.
